# Sequence Analysis Pipelines

The Sequence Analysis Pipelines (SAP) library, from GeneMAP and the [Sickle in Africa](https://www.sickleinafrica.org/) consortium, is a library of fully executable scripts for performing all kinds of NGS sequencing workflows that follow the best practice guidelines as published in the medical genomics literature. 

The docs for the SAP library include the four kinds of necessary documentation: tutorials, how-to's, references, and explanations. Please report any encountered bugs as issues on the project github pages, we greatly appreciate any user feedback.
