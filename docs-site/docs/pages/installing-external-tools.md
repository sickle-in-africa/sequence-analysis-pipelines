The pipeline library uses many external tools. Not all tools are needed by all pipelines, and there are many external tools and other dependencies that the library requires, so it is best to start by installing just those tools needed by your chosen pipeline. 

Here we will install the tools in the `<SAP-path>/tools` directory, not system-wide, so our advice will differ slightly from that given by the Broad institute in the link provided above.
